## What I'm Building
[ONE SENTENCE: What does your app let users do?]
---
## 1. MY N8N AUTOMATION (Fill This In)
What it does: [WHAT DOES YOUR WORKFLOW DO?]
Input: [WHAT DOES A USER SUBMIT? URL? TEXT? FILE?]
Output: [WHAT COMES BACK? JSON? TEXT? REPORT?]
How long it takes: [SECONDS? MINUTES?]
Webhook URL: [PASTE YOUR N8N WEBHOOK URL OR "will add
later"]
---
## 2. FRONTEND ✓ Pre-configured
Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router (NOT Pages Router)
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Why: Frontend + API in one project, deploys easily, AI knows
it well
Pages needed:
- / (landing page)
- /login
- /signup
- /dashboard (list past jobs, submit new ones)
- /dashboard/[id] (view single result)
---
## 3. BACKEND / API ✓ Pre-configuredUsing: Next.js API Routes (built into Next.js)
Why: No separate backend server to manage
Endpoints needed:
- POST /api/jobs — create job, trigger n8n
- GET /api/jobs/[id] — get job status/results
- POST /api/webhooks/n8n — receive results from n8n
---
## 4. DATABASE ✓ Pre-configured
Using: Supabase (Postgres)
Why: Free tier, great dashboard, auth included
Tables needed:
- profiles (user info)
- jobs (status, input, output, timestamps)
Row Level Security: Users can only see their own jobs
---
## 5. AUTH ✓ Pre-configured
Using: Supabase Auth
Why: Comes with database, handles email/password + OAuth
Flow:
- Sign up → create profile
- Log in → access dashboard
- Protected routes redirect to /login if not authenticated
---
## 6. HOSTING ✓ Pre-configured
App: Vercel (free tier)Why: Made for Next.js, push to deploy, handles SSL
n8n: Already self-hosted (no changes needed)
Domain: [YOUR DOMAIN OR "will use Vercel default for now"]
---
## 7. N8N ↔ APP CONNECTION ✓ Pre-configured
How it works:
1. User submits input on your site
2. Your app creates job record (status: pending)
3. Your app calls n8n webhook with { job_id, input }
4. n8n does the work
5. n8n calls YOUR app back at /api/webhooks/n8n with results
6. Your app updates job record (status: completed)
7. Frontend shows results to user
Webhook secret: [GENERATE A RANDOM STRING FOR SECURITY]
---
## 8. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ✓ Pre-configured
You'll need to set these up (Claude will help):
```
# Supabase (get from Supabase dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
# n8n
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=
N8N_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
```---
# WHAT TO DO WITH THIS
1. Fill in the blanks above (just section 1 really)
2. Open Claude Code in an empty project folder
3. Paste this entire file and say:
"Here's my CLAUDE.md blueprint for a SaaS I'm building
around my n8n automation. Review it, ask me any clarifying
questions about my automation, then help me flesh out the
database schema, file structure, and anything else before we
start coding."
4. Work with Claude to complete the blueprint
5. Then start building step by step
